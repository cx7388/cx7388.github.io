    "BACHELOR_KULEUVEN_TEXT":"When I was an bachelor Electronics Engineering student at KU Leuven, I started to get involved in various computer technologies and programming techniques. I gradually liked programming, and its logic made me feel happy. Studying at KU Leuven is hard but with pleasure. I still think that I changed my major and went to Leuven is the most important decision in my life.",
    "BACHELOR_SWJTU_TEXT":"Southwest Jiaotong University is where the dream starts. I studied vehicle engineering at Southwest Jiaotong University and achieved good results. I have won two times of scholarships and ranked the top ten among more than 200 students. But I gradually felt that the things I learned in vehicle engineering were too rigid. I want more flexible and cutting-edge knowledge. At that time, I learned that SWJTU had a 2+2 project with KU Leuven, so I signed up and passed the test to KU Leuven."
